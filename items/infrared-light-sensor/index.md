# Infrared Light Sensor

A small light that when placed on a wall will light up whenever the ghost or a player passes it.

## Tips

- turn off the lights to make it more visible
- if you place it near the ghost's room, watch it to see when the ghost is active
- during setup place it on the wall near the entrance so it is still useful (but not so you hide and forget it)

# UV Flashlight

A flashlight that shines a UV light to detect fingerprints and handprints if the ghost interacts with doors, windows and light switches.

It is also a decent emergency flashlight.

## During the hunt

The UV flashlight flickers when the hunt is going to begin.

Turn off the flashlight during the hunt to help you hide.

## Notes

You might not detect fingerprints or handprints immediately. Be patient and keep checking.

Footprints do **not** count.

## Tips

- each person should carry one of these during setup to quickly find the ghost's room
- the glowstick is an alternative to the UV light

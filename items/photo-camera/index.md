# Photo Camera

A camera that is used to take photos of evidence, ghost actions, optional objectives and bonus items (like bones).

Photos show up inside your Journal.

## Photos of evidence

Only these things require a photo:

- fingerprints
- Ghost Orb

## Optional objectives

Some optional objectives require you to take a photo of an object:

- a sink full of dirty water
- the thermometer reading freezing temperatures (-10C)

## What other can I take photos of

- the ghost
- a dead player
- bones on the ground

## Tips

- leave a camera in the van near the monitor to possibly take photos of the Ghost Orb
- some ghosts run away when you take a photo of it
- if you only have 1 camera only take photos of evidence first to conserve it

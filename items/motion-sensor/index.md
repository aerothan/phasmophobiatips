# Motion Sensor

A device that when placed on the wall will alert you in the van if anything passes near it.

## Tips

- place in a corridor or doorway near the ghost's room to alert you when it is moving
- place it during setup somewhere near the entrance so it is still useful until you find the ghost's room (but it isn't far away)

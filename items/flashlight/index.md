# Flashlight

The flashlight is a simple item that is simply used to light up a small area. It never runs out of battery.

**It is not a light source for specific types of ghosts that care about lights.**

## During the hunt

When the hunt begins, your flashlight will flicker.

## Tips

- turn it off during the hunt to hide from the ghost better
- place it on your hips to always light up the area

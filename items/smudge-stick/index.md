# Smudge Stick

**Delay Hunt: 5 seconds**

This item is a single-use item that can help the holder defend against the ghost during a hunt and can delay the hunt when it begins.

## Start of the hunt

When the hunt is starting (lights flickering) you can light it to delay the hunt for 5 seconds.

## During the hunt

When the hunt has begun (lights stopped flickering) and the ghost is nearby, light it with a lighter and the ghost will avoid trying to kill you.

It can still kill you and it might not protect your nearby friends.

## Completing the optional objective

Use the smudge stick correctly to complete the optional objective for a reward.

## Tips

- bring the maximum of 4 smudge sticks to help defend yourself
- place a smudge stick in a common place such as a side table everyone passes for emergency situations
- leave the lighter near the smudge stick otherwise the stick is useless

- Smudge Sticks can no longer be used to take the Ghost out of it's hunting phase. Instead it will now have a delayed use and stop the Ghost from targeting a player for a short time to give you extra time to hide.

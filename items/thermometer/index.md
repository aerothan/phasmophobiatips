# Thermometer

A device that reports the temperature of whatever it is aiming at.

It is only really useful for completing the optional objective of detecting a freezing cold room (-10C).

## Optional objective

You must take a photo of the thermometer to complete the optional objective.

## Tips

- if you do not have the optional objective just leave it in the van

# Tips and Tricks

A list of tips and tricks to help you defeat the ghost and win the game.

## General

### Avoid the darkness

It drops your sanity which makes the ghost stronger.

## Voice detection

### Speak slowly and clearly

It uses Microsoft Cortana which is never perfect.

### Ensure your mouse cursor has clicked on the game window

Otherwise the entire recognition system breaks. Test it by using the Spirit Box and checking it replies.

## Setup phase

### Only take items to find the ghost's room

The remaining items can be retrieved when you return to the van.

Items you should initially bring:

- EMF Reader
- UV Flashlight
- Spirit Box
- candles (to detect their movement)
- any sensors you have purchased

### Use a phone timer app

Bring along a kitchen timer or phone timer app during the setup time to let you know how long is left in the setup phase.

**If you alt-tab to a website for a timer it might break your voice recognition!**
